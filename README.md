# Overview

 As a beginner software developer who hopes to pursue this career path, I am seeking to learn the basics of as many programming languages as I can, so that I can develop my skills and diversify my professional portfolio. I am learning these languages by creating simple programs, such as this Java number guessing game, to help me familiarize myself with the basics of each language. 

This software is a number guessing game. You are given 10 tries to guess the correct number from 1-100 that has been randomly generated. If you are able to guess the number within 10 tries, you win! If you use up all of your tries, then you get a game over. The number of tries left are printed on the screen, and decrease after each try, so you are able to keep track of how many tries you have left. 

I wrote this software so that I could become familiar with the basic syntax of the Java programming language. I wanted to learn Java becausse it is a language that is widely used within the software development field.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

- I used a Java Development Kit (JDK) to install Java onto my computer.
- I used VSCode to write and edit my program.
- I installed the VSCode extension, Extension Pack for Java, so that I could write Java in VSCode.

The programming language that I used was Java. The Java library I used was the util library. The util library allowed me to import the Random, Scanner, and ArrayList classes that I needed for my code.

# Future Work

- I can ask the player if they'd like to play again instead of terminating the program once it's finished.
- With the previous idea in mind, I can create a point system that adds or subtracts points based on if the player is able to guess the number or not.
- I could make an option that lets the player decide the range of numbers to guess between, instead of just automatically assigning the range of 1-100.
